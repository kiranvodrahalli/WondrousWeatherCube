HOW THE WONDROUS WEATHER CUBE WORKS

SIDE 1: Weather (Warm = green, Cold = red: color shades are scaled)
SIDE 6: NASDAQ %change (Red = -, Green = +: color shades are scaled)
        Also, the higher the magnitude, the faster the cube blinks. 

The other four sides are transparent so you the color of the cube can diffuse 
nicely.

The cube distinguishes which app is running through the use of a photosensor:
If the photosensor is facedown, the weather app will run. If the photosensor is
face-up, the NASDAQ app will run. 

In the future, the cube could potentially be extended to more functionality.
