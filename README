 * WONDROUS WEATHER CUBE */ 

A cube that tells you the local weather. And delta NASDAQ. 
Switch between these two functionalities by flipping the cube over.
 
In WEATHER mode, the cube glows red if it's cold, and green if it's warm.
The shade of color is proportional to the magnitude of the temperature.

In NASDAQ mode, the cube glows green if there was a percent increase in NASDAQ
recently, and red if there was a percept decrease. The shade of green/red is
proportional to the magnitude of the increase/decrease. Also, the cube blinks
faster if the magnitude of the increase/decrease is higher (more alarming!)
